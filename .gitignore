# End-user optimization: Files that change frequently during bot operation
# These should not be committed but are normal for end users to have:
# - RR_bot.log (bot operation logs)
# - bot_feed*.png (screenshots)
# - debug.log (debug output when enabled)  
# - units/ (user's selected unit deck)
# - config.ini is kept in repo as template but users will modify it

# Distribution optimization: Include these for end users
# !rank_model.pkl      # ML model - needed for operation
# !all_units/          # Unit templates - needed for recognition
# !icons/              # GUI icons - needed for interface
# !.scrcpy/            # ADB tools - auto-downloaded but keep if present
